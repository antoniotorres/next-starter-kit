# Next Starter Kit

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This repo is a NextJS starter kit that includes the following libraries out of the box:

- [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org): For safety and cleaner code
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com): a CSS framework to build designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.
- [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint): lints your commit messages and checks if they meet the [conventional commit format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).
- [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release): automates the whole package release workflow including: determining the next version number, generating the release notes and publishing the package.
- [eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint): statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems.
- [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier): an opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent style by parsing your code.

## Getting Started
